			"explanation": "Social issues are the areas where older and younger people are most likely to disagree with each other. Of all 30 Vote Compass questions, this one produced the largest gap between the averages of younger and older people. All three age groups are likely to disagree with the statement, just to differing degrees."

Milennials and the older generation are in agreement with each other, with Gen Xers the odd ones out. Overall, 63 per cent of Australians say they are in favour of a price on carbon, up from 50 per cent in 2013.",

			"explanation": "You could be forgiven for thinking that older people, faced with more health issues, would be more inclined to want to pay less of their health care costs. But Vote Compass results suggest the opposite: Milennial voters are more likely to say \"less\"."
