			"explanation": "Social issues are the areas where older and younger people are most likely to disagree with each other. Of all 30 Vote Compass questions, this one produced the largest gap between the averages of younger and older people. All three age groups are likely to disagree with the statement, just to differing degrees."

			"explanation": "Port leases wouldn't be at the top of most people's lists of hot button topics, but this question did produce the second biggest gap between younger and older voters. All age groups agreed with the question, but older people were more likely to have strong opinions. "

			"explanation": "You could be forgiven for thinking that older people, faced with more health issues, would be more inclined to want to pay less of their health care costs. But Vote Compass results suggest the opposite: Gen Y voters are more likely to say \"less\"."

Not only is there a large gap between the points on the scale, but they are split either side of the agree/disagree line. No surprises about which demographic lands on which side though, with transgender issues a relatively new topic of wider public interest.",
