			"explanation": "Malcolm Turnbull's party has long campaigned for a cheaper NBN, but their supporters do not appear to share their enthusiasm for saving money when it comes to fast internet. All groups agree that cost is not the most important factor in building the NBN."

			"explanation": "This is one of 17 questions on which L/NP voters are on one side, with ALP and GRN voters on the other side of the middle line. Given Malcolm Turnbull's longstanding public support for Australia becoming a republic, it's also one issue on which he is out of step with the conservative base of his party."

ALP voters are slightly inclined to disagree with the statement, but GRN voters are in favour."
